# Pi-Power

Simple 3 Amp power supply board to power the single board computer over GPIO.  Input should be between 9 and 24 VDC.

Help keep me free to do this sort of thing, if the designs pay for themselves there will be more:

Board breaks out SPI and I2C, and provides some 5V 2.54mm headers toward the bottom and some general proto area in the middle.
